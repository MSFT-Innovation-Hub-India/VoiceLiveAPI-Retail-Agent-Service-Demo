## üèóÔ∏è Solution Architecture

![Solution Architecture](./images/architecture.png)

### Seamless Voice Enablement with Azure Voice Live API

Traditional approaches to building voice-enabled AI assistants would require significant architectural changes and custom development. However, with **Azure Voice Live API**, the same development team that built a text-based agent doesn't need to worry about making the agent itself voice-enabled‚Äîit becomes a seamless wrapper around their existing intelligent system.

Azure Voice Live API transforms this landscape by providing:

üéôÔ∏è **Single Integration Point** - The Voice Live API sits as an elegant wrapper around the existing agent, requiring minimal integration effort

üß† **Zero Agent Modification** - The core Agentic System in Azure AI Foundry remains unchanged; all autonomous capabilities, tool actions, and business logic persist exactly as designed

üîÑ **Turnkey Speech Capabilities** - Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, Voice Activity Detection (VAD), echo cancellation, and noise suppression come built-in without additional development

‚ö° **Real-time Streaming** - Bidirectional audio streaming with minimal latency enables natural conversation flow

üõ°Ô∏è **Enterprise Ready** - Built-in security, compliance, and scalability features suitable for production deployments

### Architecture Components

This application uses a modular architecture for better maintainability and reusability:

- **`app.py`** - Main Chainlit application and UI orchestration
- **`voicelive_client.py`** - Azure Voice Live API client with WebSocket handling

- **Automated Shipment Processing**: Integration with Azure Logic Apps for order fulfillment
- **AI-Powered Conversation Analytics**: GPT-4o powered analysis with Cosmos DB storage
- **Vector File Search**: Intelligent QnA capabilities for policies and support topics

## üîß Recent Improvements

### Placeholder Message Optimization (Latest Update)
- **Issue Fixed**: The AI assistant was misinterpreting descriptive placeholder messages like "üé§ Listening..." and "[Voice input - processing transcript...]" as file upload indicators
- **Solution Implemented**: Simplified all placeholder messages to use neutral "..." text
- **Benefit**: Eliminates false "file upload" responses from the assistant, ensuring smooth voice conversations
- **Files Modified**: `app.py` - Updated `ensure_user_message_placeholder()`, `handle_conversation_thread_updated()`, `handle_user_input_transcript_done()`, and `handle_user_speech_stopped()` functions

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- An Azure AI Foundry project/agent configured for Voice Live
- Ability to obtain AAD tokens via DefaultAzureCredential (e.g., Azure CLI sign-in)

## ü§ñ AI Agent Configuration

When setting up your AI Agent in Azure AI Foundry, use the following system prompt:

```
You are an AI Agent tasked with helping the customers of Contoso retail fashions with their shopping requirements. You have access to the following:
- APIs in contoso_retail_fashion_api that you need to call to respond to the user queries. 
- Once the customer purchases the merchandise, you will help them with a Shipment order based on the delivery address provided by them. 
- You will also use the File Search tool to help with QnA
- Once the customer concludes the call or indicates that the call can be ended, then send the entire conversation log to the ContosoRetailCallLogAnalytics_Tool tool action for analysis. The data you send should be like:
{
  "conversation": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "message": "user input"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "message": "agent response"
    },

    {
      "role": "user",
      "message": "Hey, what do you have in winter wear?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "message": "agent response sdasdasd "
    },
..... and so on ..... 
      ]
}

Important confirmation requirements:
- When the user places an order, always reconfirm with all the particulars (product details, quantities, prices, total amount) before creating the order. Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.
- When creating the shipment order, always seek confirmation from the user about the destination address provided before creating it. Repeat back the complete address and ask for confirmation before proceeding.
```

This system prompt configures the agent to:
- Act as a Contoso retail fashion assistant
- Use the retail fashion APIs for product queries
- Handle shipment orders post-purchase with Azure Logic App integration
- Utilize Vector File Search for QnA on policies, returns, payments, and support topics
- **Automated conversation analytics** using GPT-4o powered Azure Logic App
- **Confirm order details** before placing orders
- **Verify shipping addresses** before creating shipments
- **Capture and analyze** complete conversation logs for sentiment and performance insights

See the screenshot of the Agent existing in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service:

## üìä Call Log Analytics Configuration

The conversation analytics feature uses a separate Azure Logic App with GPT-4o to analyze call quality and extract insights. This Logic App uses the following system prompt and function schema:

![Call Analysis Logic App](./images/call_analysis_logicapp.png)

### Call Log Evaluation System Prompt:
```
You are a Call Center Quality Evaluator AI for Contoso Retail, a fashion and apparel company.

[Your Task]
- Analyze the customer service call transcript and extract the following parameters: call_reason, product, customer_satisfaction, customer_sentiment, call_rating (1‚Äì5), call_rating_justification, and call_date.

[Evaluation Guidelines]
- Judge the call based on tone, language, and resolution of the issue.
- Identify the fashion/apparel product discussed if applicable (e.g., Men's Shirts, Women's Dresses, Shoes, Accessories, etc.) - this field can be null for general inquiries.
- If the customer is frustrated, confused, or expresses dissatisfaction, rate the sentiment accordingly.
- Use real-world judgment based on typical customer service scenarios in fashion retail (e.g., size issues, quality complaints, delivery problems, returns/exchanges).
```

### Evaluation Function Schema:
The Logic App uses a structured function call `evaluate_call_log` that extracts:

- **call_reason**: Categorized from 50+ predefined retail scenarios (Order status inquiry, Size exchange request, Defective item received, etc.)
- **product**: Specific fashion/apparel product discussed (optional)
- **customer_satisfaction**: Overall satisfaction level assessment
- **customer_sentiment**: Emotional tone analysis
- **call_rating**: Numerical rating (1-5 scale)

## üé§ How to Use

- Click "üéô Start Voice" to begin a voice session. Speak naturally; server VAD detects turns.
- The assistant replies with audio and text. User messages appear right‚Äëaligned; assistant left.
- You can also type. Sending text cancels any ongoing assistant audio and triggers a fresh reply.
- Click "üõë Stop Voice" to end the voice session (you can continue typing if desired).

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Voice & Chat Features:
- Real-time voice conversation with server VAD and noise suppression
- Echo control: server echo cancellation plus half‚Äëduplex mic gating with tail cooldown
- Live transcripts for user speech and assistant replies
- Typed chat supported; safe session-ready gating to avoid early drops
- Immediate interruption on new input (voice or text) to keep the flow natural
- Optimized placeholder messages that don't confuse the AI assistant

### Advanced Business Features:
- **Automated Order Fulfillment**: Seamless integration with Azure Logic Apps for shipment creation in Azure SQL Database
- **Intelligent QnA Support**: Vector-powered File Search for policies, returns, and payment assistance
- **AI-Powered Analytics**: GPT-4o driven conversation analysis with sentiment scoring and performance evaluation stored in Azure Cosmos DB
- **End-to-End Order Management**: From product inquiry to shipment tracking with full automation

## üß≠ High-level Flow

### Voice & Chat Flow:
1) Chainlit UI ‚Üê‚Üí WebSocket client
2) Azure Voice Live API session configured (VAD, noise/echo, voice)
3) Mic audio ‚Üí `input_audio_buffer.append`
4) Server transcribes; user transcript is rendered with simple "..." placeholder
5) Agent responds; audio frames stream back and are played
6) Mic is temporarily gated during assistant audio and for a short cooldown

### Business Process Flow:
7) **Product Queries**: Agent searches product catalog via retail APIs
8) **Order Processing**: Agent places order and requests delivery address
9) **Shipment Creation**: Azure Logic App creates shipment record in Azure SQL Database
10) **QnA Support**: Vector File Search provides policy and support information
11) **Conversation Analytics**: At conversation end, full dialogue sent to GPT-4o powered Logic App
12) **Analytics Storage**: Sentiment, performance metrics, and insights stored in Azure Cosmos DB

## üõ† Troubleshooting

- "Could not reach the server" banner: Chainlit UI reconnect notice; if conversation continues, you can ignore. Refresh if it persists.
- No audio capture: ensure mic permission granted and the correct input device is active.
- Self‚Äëinterruptions/echo: increase cooldown settings in the session config.
- Assistant mentions file uploads: This should be resolved with the latest placeholder message optimization. If it persists, check that all placeholder messages use simple "..." text.
- Typed message ignored on first try: ensure the app shows "Connected to Azure Voice Live API" before sending; the app already waits briefly for session readiness.
