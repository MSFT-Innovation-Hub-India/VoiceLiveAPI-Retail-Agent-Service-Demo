# Contoso Retail Assistant ‚Äî Azure Voice Live API Integration Demo

A demonstration of Speech to Speech scenarios using Azure Voice Live API integration. It showcases **two distinct approaches** for building voice-enabled AI assistants. One that uses direct model integration (GPT-Realtime) in Azure AI Foundry, and the other uses an Agent in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service.

It also covers how the Voice Agent can be extended to support Call log analytics, extraction of insights, trends. It uses Microsoft Fabric's turnkey ability to mirror data from an OLTP Database (Azure CosmosDB) into OneLake, use Data Agents to reason over this data to obtain insights and trends. Business users can use the Copilot in Microsoft Fabric to reason over this data, and finally use Power BI to create interactive charts and reports

![Call Analysis Logic App](./images/call_analysis_logicapp.png)

### Call Log Evaluation System Prompt:
```
You are a Call Center Quality Evaluator AI for Contoso Retail, a fashion and apparel company.

[Your Task]
- Analyze the customer service call transcript and extract the following parameters: call_reason, product, customer_satisfaction, customer_sentiment, call_rating (1‚Äì5), call_rating_justification, and call_date.

[Evaluation Guidelines]
- Judge the call based on tone, language, and resolution of the issue.
- Identify the fashion/apparel product discussed if applicable (e.g., Men's Shirts, Women's Dresses, Shoes, Accessories, etc.) - this field can be null for general inquiries.
- If the customer is frustrated, confused, or expresses dissatisfaction, rate the sentiment accordingly.
- Use real-world judgment based on typical customer service scenarios in fashion retail (e.g., size issues, quality complaints, delivery problems, returns/exchanges).
```

### Evaluation Function Schema:
The Logic App uses a structured function call `evaluate_call_log` that extracts:

- **call_reason**: Categorized from 50+ predefined retail scenarios (Order status inquiry, Size exchange request, Defective item received, etc.)
- **product**: Specific fashion/apparel product discussed (optional)
- **customer_satisfaction**: Overall satisfaction level assessment
- **customer_sentiment**: Emotional tone analysis
- **call_rating**: Numerical rating (1-5 scale)
- **call_rating_justification**: Key reasoning for the rating
- **call_date**: Extracted call timestamp

This structured analysis enables comprehensive call center analytics, quality monitoring, and performance insights stored in Azure Cosmos DB.
